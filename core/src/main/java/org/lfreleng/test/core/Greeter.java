     * not declare. {@code dependency:analyze} flags that as used but
     * undeclared, which is the very hygiene problem this fixture exists
     * to exercise. Building a tree instead keeps {@code jackson-core}
     * and {@code jackson-annotations} purely transitive, so one
     * declared coordinate still resolves to three components.
